kind: Bugfix
body: 'Unable to "unset" the category, level, owner and filter of a check when doing
  an Update mutation.  BREAKING CHANGE:  This change will likely cause issues with
  check update if you are not setting all the fields of a `CheckUpdateInput` This
  is because now unset id fields will be passed through as null and therefore will
  unset any values already set.  Please ensure you fill out all the fields on a `CheckUpdateInput` (or subtype) 
  when you are updating an existing check.'
