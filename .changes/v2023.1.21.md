## [January 21, 2023](https://github.com/OpsLevel/opslevel-go/compare/v2022.12.16...v2023.1.21)
### Bugfix
* Fixing issue where check notes were being deleted on updates
### Feature
* Add CRUD for custom actions webhook actions
* Add CRUD for custom actions trigger definitions
* Add a new input type "JSON" which supports turning a map[string]string into escaped json when used in mutation input
### Refactor
* removed "NewEmptyString" function by refactoring "NewString" to work in the expected way.  This maybe cause a BREAKING CHANGE!
* Add a "HandleErrors" method that wraps "FormatErrors" to reduce code paths and increase test coverage
* refactor "NewId" method to allow for "null" as a value for Update mutations where the input can have a null ID field that acts as an "unset" this field
* BREAKING CHANGE: Make new ID type that works like our API expects.  The entire codebase has been refactor and method signatures have been changed to use the builtin ID type instead of graphql.ID type.  This will fix a number of bugs with Update mutations being unable to "unset" or null out an IDs where permitted.
* Refactored error handling in methods to increase code coverage and reduce branching code paths
* Deprecated `DeleteGroupWithAlias` in favor of `DeleteGroup` handling both ID or Alias
### Dependency
* Bump github.com/relvacode/iso8601 from 1.1.0 to 1.3.0
* Bump github.com/hashicorp/go-retryablehttp from 0.7.1 to 0.7.2
