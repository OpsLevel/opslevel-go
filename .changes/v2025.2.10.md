## [February 10, 2025](https://github.com/OpsLevel/opslevel-go/compare/v2024.12.24...v2025.2.10)
### Feature
* 'metadata' field has been added to AlertSource struct
* 'description' field has been added to Category struct
* Struct 'Scorecard' has been updated to match all the fields possible in the API
* Add ability to CRUD 'ComponentType'
* Add aliases functions for CRUD components that use the old services CRUD functions
* Add support for the `provisionedBy` field on User type
### Refactor
* BREAKING CHANGE: "Nullable" type now wraps some optional struct fields of API input objects. This "Nullable" type enables fields to be set to the JSON "null" value.
* convert enum consts into vars for easier pointer referencing
* enums converted from consts to vars, e.g. opslevel.RefOf(opslevel.AlertSourceTypeEnumDatadog) should now be &opslevel.AlertSourceTypeEnumDatadog
* BREAKING CHANGE: 'OpsLevelErrors' has been renamed to 'Error'
* BREAKING CHANGE: Struct 'GoogleCloudProject' fields `ID` and `URL` are now `Id` and `Url` respectively
* Field 'ChecksCount' has been renamed to 'TotalChecks' on the struct 'Scorecard' to match the API definition
* Field 'ID' on struct 'Secret' has been renamed to 'Id' for consistency
* BREAKING CHANGE: struct 'OpsLevelWarnings' was renamed to 'Warning'
* BREAKING CHANGE: client.GetService now properly takes in an identifier and calls the appropreate queries for alias or id
* BREAKING CHANGE: the `notes` field on check input types doesn't support `null` only `""` and `"filled"` values or not present.
