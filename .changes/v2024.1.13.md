## [January 13, 2024](https://github.com/OpsLevel/opslevel-go/compare/v2023.12.14...v2024.1.13)

This release contains a multitude of breaking changes. This release marks that beginning of applying code generation to opslevel-go to standardize the codebase to both speed up development and ensure consistency and correctness. A number of methods have had their signatures changed as well as several methods have been deprecated and previously deprecated methods have been removed.

### Bugfix
* Fix bug where Team inputs did not omit optional ParentTeam field
* Fix bug where optional IdentifierInput fields could never be unset - this can now be done by passing NewIdentifier() with no args
* Add missing yaml tags for *IdentifierInput and *ID
### Feature
* add yaml and default struct tags to Input structs
* Add support for assigning Properties to Services
* add task ci, standardizing task usage in our CI
* Create null IdentifierInput by passing no arguments to NewIdentifier()
* Bump github.com/go-resty/resty/v2 from 2.10.0 to 2.11.0
* add RefOf() to take place of NewString(), NewInt(), Bool()
* add NewManualCheckFrequencyUpdateInput() factory function
* update InfraProviderInput.Data to type JSON, was map[string]any
* add JSONSchema() type, similar to JSON type, needed to match GraphQL API
* Bump github.com/hasura/go-graphql-client from 0.10.1 to 0.10.2
* add NewCheckCreateInputTypeOf and NewCheckCreateUpdateTypeOf factory funcs
* Add RefTo - alias for RefOf
### Refactor
* Update code to support change in schema and new Property Definition fields
* [BREAKING CHANGE] Use string as argument for all client request functions instead of requiring an IdentifierInput
* BREAKING CHANGE renamed JSONString type to JsonString to match GraphQL API
* BREAKING CHANGE PropertyDefinition.Schema type is now JSONSchema, was JSON
* Combine DeleteService(ID) and DeleteServiceWithAlias(string) into a unified function
* DeleteScorecard() now returns a pointer like other Delete functions
* List() functions consistently return a (*Connection, error)
* Merge DeleteTeam(ID) and DeleteTeamWithAlias(string) into DeleteTeam(identifier string)
* NewIdentifierInput() now returns a pointer to be consistent with NewIdentifier()
* JSON functions now return (ptr, error) instead of panic()-ing
### Deprecated
* deprecated NewString(), NewInt(), Bool() - use RefOf() instead
### Removed
* all Groups structs, related functions, and Group type fields from other structs
* DomainId and SystemId member func - Tags
* Service member func - Documents
* Team member func - GetMembers
* Client member funcs - AssignTagsForAlias, AssignTagForAlias, AssignTagsForId, AssignTagForId, CreateTagsForId
* Client member funcs - GetToolsForServiceWithAlias, GetToolsForServiceWithId, GetToolsForService, GetToolCount
* Client member funcs - AddMember, AddMembers, RemoveMembers, RemoveMembers, DeleteTeamWithId, GetTeamWithId
* Client member funcs - GetServiceWithId, GetTagsForServiceWithAlias, GetTagsForServiceWithId, GetTagsForService, GetTagCount
